This project was fun and challenging. Absolutely broke my brain in half to calculate 0./0. correctly during the final steps. 
This project was a little bit of a slow starter, but I managed quickly to add the Clear button and these continuous math operations. 
I was stuck for quite a while with adding the backspace since I separate the numbers in seperate variables on the left and right side
of the operator. It was a little bit confusing because I had to write a lot of nested if else statements. Lastly I need to do is to 
put a max characters, now the numbers theoretically can run out of the calculator. Also, I think I could have used less code. But I managed
to add the backspace and the keyboard support. This was a good learning experience.
